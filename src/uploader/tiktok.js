// Placeholder: TikTok uploading via official API requires Business accounts and specific permissions.
// Many users rely on headless browser automation with session cookies, which tends to be brittle.
// Here we provide a stub that throws unless a token/method is supplied.

  // Implement with your preferred method (e.g., Playwright + cookies) and remove the throw.
